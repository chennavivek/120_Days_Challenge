The Pandavas  were the five legendary brothers and central characters of the Indian epic  Mahabharata . They were the sons of  King Pandu  (hence the name *Pandavas*) and were known for their righteousness, valor, and adherence to  dharma (duty) .  

###  The Five Pandavas: 
1.  Yudhishthira  (Son of  Dharma , god of justice) – Eldest, known for truthfulness and wisdom.  
2.  Bhima  (Son of  Vayu , god of wind) – Strongest, known for his immense physical power.  
3.  Arjuna  (Son of  Indra , king of gods) – Greatest archer and central figure of the  Bhagavad Gita .  
4.  Nakula  (Son of the Ashvins) – Skilled in swordsmanship and horse-keeping.  
5.  Sahadeva  (Son of the Ashvins) – Expert in astrology and warfare strategies.  

###  Key Aspects of the Pandavas: 
-  Marriage to Draupadi : All five brothers married  Draupadi , daughter of King Drupada, due to a misunderstanding caused by their mother  Kunti’s  words.  
-  Exile & Gambling Loss : They lost their kingdom in a rigged dice game against their cousins, the  Kauravas , and were exiled for  13 years .  
-  Kurukshetra War : After their exile, the Pandavas fought the  Mahabharata war  against the Kauravas to reclaim their kingdom. With  Lord Krishna’s  guidance, they emerged victorious.  
-  Final Journey : After ruling for many years, the Pandavas and Draupadi undertook a final journey to the Himalayas, where they died one by one, ascending to heaven.  

###  Symbolism & Legacy: 
The Pandavas represent different virtues— righteousness (Yudhishthira), strength (Bhima), skill (Arjuna), beauty & loyalty (Nakula & Sahadeva) . Their lives teach lessons about  duty, morality, and the consequences of greed and ego  (as seen in their conflict with the Kauravas).
