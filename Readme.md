# 120 Days Data Analyst Challenge

This repository documents my journey through a 120-day Data Analyst learning challenge. It contains Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, assignments, and datasets covering core data analysis concepts and practical exercises.

## Project Structure

- **Basics/**: Python basics, practice scripts, and exercises.
- **Data_structure/**: Assignments and solutions for lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.
- **Exception_handling/**: Notebooks and scripts for exception handling in Python.
- **File_Handling/**: Reading, writing, and manipulating files in Python.
- **Function_Tasks/**: Function assignments and solutions.
- **Import_module/**: Examples of Python module imports and usage.
- **Library/**: Usage of standard and third-party libraries.
- **OOP/**: Object-Oriented Programming concepts, including classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **package/**: Example Python packages and modules.
- **Data_Analysis_with_Python/**: Data analysis assignments using Pandas and NumPy, including CSV files and Jupyter notebooks.
- **test_directory/**: Miscellaneous test scripts and files.

## Example Files

- `sample.txt`, `destination.txt`, `example_file.txt`, etc.: Sample text files for file handling exercises.
- `Car_sales.csv`, `example.csv`: Example datasets for data analysis tasks.

## Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Browse each folder for topic-specific assignments and solutions. Jupyter notebooks are used for interactive exercises, while `.py` files contain script-based solutions.
